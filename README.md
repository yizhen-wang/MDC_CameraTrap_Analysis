## Introduction
MDC CameraTrap Analysis is a comprehensive animal analysis tool developed for MDC (Missouri Department of Conservation). This project focuses on processing CameraTrap image data and provides the following key functionalities:
- **Existence Detection**: Detects whether animals are present in the images.
- **Counting**: Counts the number of animals in a single image or a sequence of images.
- **Object Detection**: Detects and localizes animals within images.
- **Classification**: Classifies different animal species captured by CameraTraps.

The project supports both single-image analysis and batch processing for continuous shooting mode (sequential images), offering a complete solution for wildlife monitoring.
